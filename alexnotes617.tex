Notes for 6/17/19. Alex Pyryt.
My main focus currently is figuring out a way to automate gazebo world file creation.
I have figured out that the models belong between two generic blocks of settings.
I am not yet sure how to handle adding model files. Some model files seem to have custom scale or size settings.
